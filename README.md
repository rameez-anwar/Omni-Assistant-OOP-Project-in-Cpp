RESTful APIs: Utilizes external APIs to access weather data (WeatherAPI), calendar events (Google Calendar API), and chatbot responses (OpenAI API).
JSON Parsing: Parses JSON data from API responses using the RapidJSON library.
libcurl: Handles HTTP requests to interact with APIs.
System Calls: Executes commands to open external applications (e.g., music player, browser).
